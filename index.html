    <h1>My Career Goals</h1> 
        <p>I want to become a software developer but since I am a working professional, I can't take a cenventional path of going to school fulltime. I must learn to code on my own in my free time and by attending classes like <b>ARTDM171</b>.</p>
        <p>I already have some working knowledge of languages like <em>Perl, Python and C++ </em>but I want to learn <em>HTML with CSS</em> and then move on to <em>JavaScript</em> because there is a higher probability in finding a good job and possibly a career doing the front-end programing.</p>
        
        <p>I am hoping to learn as much as I can about <i>HTML</i> by the end of the semester in a way that Iâ€™ll be confident designing and creating a website without any help. This enables me to move on to other programs such a JavaScript to be able to <strong>stay on track and pursue and execute my goals and plans</strong>.</p>
